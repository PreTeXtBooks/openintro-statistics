          The actual data has more observations than were referenced

          That is, we used a subsample since it helped smooth some

          In New York City on October 23rd, 2014, a doctor who had
          recently been treating Ebola patients in Guinea went to
          the hospital with a slight fever and was subsequently
          diagnosed with Ebola.
          Soon thereafter, an NBC 4 New York/The Wall Street
          Journal/Marist Poll found that
          82% of New Yorkers favored a
          "mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone who has come
          in contact with an Ebola patient".
          This poll included responses of 1,042

          Taiji was featured in the movie
          <em>The Cove</em>, and it is a significant source of dolphin
          and whale meat in Japan.
          Thousands of dolphins pass through the Taiji area annually,
          and we assume these 19 dolphins reasonably represent
          a simple random sample from those dolphins.

          Data were collected by OpenIntro staff in 2010 and again
          in 2018.
          For the 2018 sample, we sampled 201 UCLA courses.
          Of those, 68 required books that could be
          found on Amazon.

          We did omit discussion of some structure in
          the data for the analysis presented:
          the experiment design included blocking,
          where typically four resumes were sent to each job:
          one for each inferred race/sex combination
          (as inferred based on the first name).
          We did not worry about this blocking aspect,
          since accounting for the blocking would
          <em>reduce</em> the standard error without notably
          changing the point estimates for the
          race and sex variables
          versus the analysis performed in the section.
          That is, the most interesting conclusions in the
          study are unaffected even when completing a more
          sophisticated analysis.
