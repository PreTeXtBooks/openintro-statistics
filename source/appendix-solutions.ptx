          higher standard deviation since -40 is farther away from the rest of the data than -20.</li>
          <li>Dist 2 has a higher mean since all values in this distribution are higher
          than those in Dist 1, but both distributions have the same standard deviation
          since they are equally variable around their respective means.</li>
          <li>Both distributions have the same mean since they're both centered at 300, but

          Lower fence: <m>\text{Q1} - 1.5 \times \text{IQR} = 17.5 - 1.5 \times 20 = -12.5</m>; The lowest AQI
          recorded is not lower than 5 and the highest AQI recorded is not higher than 65, which
          are both within the fences. Therefore none of the days in this sample would be considered

    <p>
      This appendix provides a foundation for the exercise solutions structure.
      The complete conversion of all 2,588 lines of exercise solutions from the LaTeX source
      would require additional systematic conversion work to transform all <c>\eocesol{}</c> macros,
      mathematical notation, figures, and multi-column layouts into proper PreTeXt format.
