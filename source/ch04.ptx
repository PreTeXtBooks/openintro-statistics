  <title>Distributions of random variables</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we discuss statistical distributions that frequently arise 
      in the context of data analysis or statistical inference. We start with the 
      normal distribution in the first section, which is used frequently in later 
      chapters of this book. The remaining sections will occasionally be referenced 
      but may be considered optional for the content in this book.

    <title>Normal distribution</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Among all the distributions we see in practice, one is overwhelmingly the 
        most common. The symmetric, unimodal, bell curve is ubiquitous throughout 
        statistics. Indeed it is so common, that people often know it as the normal 
        curve or normal distribution.

      <p>
        Variables such as SAT scores and heights of US adult males closely follow 
        the normal distribution.

      <title>Normal distribution model</title>
      <p>
        The <term>normal distribution</term> always describes a symmetric, unimodal, bell-shaped 
        curve. However, these curves can look different depending on the details of 
        the model. Specifically, the normal distribution model can be adjusted using 
        two parameters: mean and standard deviation. As you can probably guess, changing the mean 
        shifts the bell curve to the left or right, while changing the standard deviation stretches 
        or constricts the curve. <xref ref="fig-two-sample-normals"/> shows the normal distribution 
        with mean <m>0</m> and standard deviation <m>1</m> in the left panel and the normal 
        distribution with mean <m>19</m> and standard deviation <m>4</m> in the right panel. 
        <xref ref="fig-two-sample-normals-stacked"/> shows these distributions on the same axis.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        If a normal distribution has mean <m>\mu</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma</m>, 
        we may write the distribution as <m>N(\mu, \sigma)</m>. The two distributions in 
        <xref ref="fig-two-sample-normals-stacked"/> may be written as
        <md>
          <mrow>N(\mu=0, \sigma=1) \quad \text{and} \quad N(\mu=19, \sigma=4)</mrow>
        </md>
        Because the mean and standard deviation describe a normal distribution exactly, 
        they are called the distribution's <term>parameters</term>.

        <p>
          Many variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal. Thus the normal 
          distribution, while not perfect for any single problem, is very useful for a variety 
          of problems. We will use it in data exploration and to solve important problems in 
          statistics.

      <title>Standardizing with Z-scores</title>
      <p>
        We often want to put data onto a standardized scale, which can make 
        comparisons more reasonable.

          <p>
            <xref ref="table-sat-act-stats"/> shows the mean and standard deviation for total 
            scores on the SAT and ACT. The distribution of SAT and ACT scores are both nearly 
            normal. Suppose Ann scored 1300 on her SAT and Tom scored 24 on his ACT. Who 
            performed better?

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We use the standard deviation as a guide. Ann is 1 standard deviation above average 
            on the SAT: <m>1100 + 200 = 1300</m>. Tom is 0.5 standard deviations above the mean 
            on the ACT: <m>21 + 0.5 \times 6 = 24</m>. In <xref ref="fig-sat-act-normals"/>, 
            we can see that Ann tends to do better with respect to everyone else than Tom did, 
            so her score was better.

        <xref ref="ex-act-sat"/> used a standardization technique called a Z-score, a method 
        most commonly employed for nearly normal observations but that may be used with any 
        distribution. The <term>Z-score</term> of an observation is defined as the number of 
        standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. If the observation is one 
        standard deviation above the mean, its Z-score is 1. If it is 1.5 standard deviations 
        <em>below</em> the mean, then its Z-score is -1.5. If <m>x</m> is an observation from 
        a distribution <m>N(\mu, \sigma)</m>, we define the Z-score mathematically as
        <me>
          Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
        </me>
        Using <m>\mu_{SAT} = 1100</m>, <m>\sigma_{SAT} = 200</m>, and 
        <m>x_{Ann} = 1300</m>, we find Ann's Z-score:
        <me>
          Z_{Ann} = \frac{x_{Ann} - \mu_{SAT}}{\sigma_{SAT}} = \frac{1300 - 1100}{200} = 1

      <p>
        Observations above the mean always have positive Z-scores, while those below the mean 
        always have negative Z-scores. If an observation is equal to the mean, such as an SAT 
        score of 1100, then the Z-score is <m>0</m>.

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-finding-tail-areas">
      <title>Finding tail areas</title>
      <p>
        It's very useful in statistics to be able to identify tail areas of distributions. 
        For instance, what fraction of people have an SAT score below Ann's score of 1300? 
        This is the same as the <term>percentile</term> Ann is at, which is the percentage 
        of cases that have lower scores than Ann. We can visualize such a tail area like the 
        curve and shading shown in <xref ref="fig-sat-below-1300"/>.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-sat-below-1300">
        <caption>The area to the left of <m>Z</m> represents the fraction of people who scored lower than Ann.</caption>
        <image source="ch_distributions/figures/satBelow1300"/>
      </figure>

      <p>
        There are many techniques for doing this, and we'll discuss three of the options.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The most common approach in practice is to use statistical software. For example, 
              in the program R, we could find the area shown in <xref ref="fig-sat-below-1300"/> 
              using the following command, which takes in the Z-score and returns the lower tail 
              area: <c>pnorm(1)</c> returns <c>0.8413447</c>. According to this calculation, 
              the region shaded that is below 1300 represents the proportion 0.841 (84.1%) of 
              SAT test takers who had Z-scores below <m>Z = 1</m>. More generally, we can also 
              specify the cutoff explicitly if we also note the mean and standard deviation: 
              <c>pnorm(1300, mean = 1100, sd = 200)</c> returns <c>0.8413447</c>.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many other software options, such as Python or SAS; even spreadsheet 
              programs such as Excel and Google Sheets support these calculations.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A common strategy in classrooms is to use a graphing calculator, such as a TI or 
              Casio calculator. These calculators require a series of button presses that are 
              less concisely described. You can find instructions on using these calculators 
              for finding tail areas of a normal distribution in the OpenIntro video library: 
              <url href="https://www.openintro.org/videos"/>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The last option for finding tail areas is to use what's called a 
              <term>probability table</term>; these are occasionally used in classrooms 
              but rarely in practice. The appendix contains such a table and a guide for 
              how to use it.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        We will solve normal distribution problems in this section by always first finding 
        the Z-score. The reason is that we will encounter close parallels called 
        <term>test statistics</term> beginning in Chapter 5; these are, in many instances, 
        an equivalent of a Z-score.

        Cumulative SAT scores are approximated well by a normal model,

        <title>Finding probability of SAT score above 1190</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Shannon is a randomly selected SAT taker, and nothing is known about Shannon's 
            SAT aptitude. What is the probability Shannon scores at least 1190 on her SATs?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            First, always draw and label a picture of the normal distribution. (Drawings need 
            not be exact to be useful.) We are interested in the chance she scores above 1190, 
            so we shade this upper tail:
          </p>

          <figure xml:id="fig-sat-above-1190">
            <caption>Shading the upper tail above 1190</caption>
            <image source="ch_distributions/figures/satAbove1190"/>
          </figure>

          <p>
            The picture shows the mean and the values at 2 standard deviations above and below 
            the mean. The simplest way to find the shaded area under the curve makes use of 
            the Z-score of the cutoff value. With <m>\mu = 1100</m>, <m>\sigma = 200</m>, 
            and the cutoff value <m>x = 1190</m>, the Z-score is computed as
            <me>
              Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{1190 - 1100}{200} = \frac{90}{200} = 0.45
            </me>
            Using statistical software (or another preferred method), we can find the area 
            left of <m>Z = 0.45</m> as 0.6736. To find the area <em>above</em> 
            <m>Z = 0.45</m>, we compute one minus the area of the lower tail:

            Identifying the mean <m>\mu=1100</m>, the standard deviation <m>\sigma=200</m>, 
            and the cutoff for the tail area <m>x=1030</m> makes it easy to compute the Z-score:

              Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{1030 - 1100}{200} = -0.35

        corresponding to a particular percentile?
      </p>

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            As always, first draw the picture.

            In this case, the lower tail probability is known (0.40), which can be shaded on 
            the diagram. We want to find the observation that corresponds to this value. As a 
            first step in this direction, we determine the Z-score associated with the 
            40<m>^{th}</m> percentile. Using software, we can obtain the corresponding Z-score 
            of about -0.25.
          </p>

          <p>
            Knowing <m>Z_{Erik} = -0.25</m> and the population parameters <m>\mu = 70</m> and 
            <m>\sigma = 3.3</m> inches, the Z-score formula can be set up to determine Erik's 
            unknown height, labeled <m>x_{Erik}</m>:
            <me>
              -0.25 = Z_{Erik} = \frac{x_{Erik} - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{x_{Erik} - 70}{3.3}
            </me>
            Solving for <m>x_{Erik}</m> yields a height of 69.18 inches. That is, Erik is 
            about 5'9''.

          <p>
            Next, we want to find the Z-score at the 82<m>^{nd}</m> percentile, which will be 
            a positive value and can be found using software as <m>Z = 0.92</m>. Finally, the 
            height <m>x</m> is found using the Z-score formula with the known mean <m>\mu</m>, 
            standard deviation <m>\sigma</m>, and Z-score <m>Z = 0.92</m>:
            <me>
              0.92 = Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{x - 70}{3.3}
            </me>
            This yields 73.04 inches or about 6'1'' as the height at the 82<m>^{nd}</m>

        Here, we present a useful rule of thumb for the probability of falling within 1, 2,

            Use software, a calculator, or a probability table to confirm that about 68%, 95%, 
            and 99.7% of observations fall within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean 
            in the normal distribution, respectively. For instance, first find the area that 
            falls between <m>Z=-1</m> and <m>Z=1</m>, which should have an area of about 0.68. 
            Similarly there should be an area of about 0.95 between <m>Z=-2</m> and <m>Z=2</m>.

        It is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4, 5, or even more standard 
        deviations from the mean. However, these occurrences are very rare if the data are 
        nearly normal. The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the 
        mean is about 1-in-15,000. For 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-2 million 
        and 1-in-500 million, respectively.

            In triathlons, it is common for racers to be placed into age and gender groups. 
            Friends Leo and Mary both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon, where Leo 
            competed in the <em>Men, Ages 30 - 34</em> group while Mary competed in the 
            <em>Women, Ages 25 - 29</em> group. Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 
            (4948 seconds), while Mary completed the race in 1:31:53 (5513 seconds). Obviously 
            Leo finished faster, but they are curious about how they did within their 
            respective groups. Can you help them? Here is some information on the performance 
            of their groups:

    <title>Geometric distribution</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        How long should we expect to flip a coin until it turns up heads? Or how many 
        times should we expect to roll a die until we get a 1? These questions can be 
        answered using the geometric distribution. We first formalize each trial<mdash />such 
        as a single coin flip or die toss<mdash />using the Bernoulli distribution, and then 
        we combine these with our tools from probability (Chapter 3) to construct the 
        geometric distribution.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-bernoulli-distribution">
      <title>Bernoulli distribution</title>

      <p>
        Many health insurance plans in the United States have a deductible, where the 
        insured individual is responsible for costs up to the deductible, and then the 
        costs above the deductible are shared between the individual and insurance company 
        for the remainder of the year.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose a health insurance company found that 70% of the people they insure stay 
        below their deductible in any given year. Each of these people can be thought of 
        as a <term>trial</term>. We label a person a <term>success</term> if her healthcare 
        costs do not exceed the deductible. We label a person a <term>failure</term> if she 
        does exceed her deductible in the year. Because 70% of the individuals will not hit 
        their deductible, we denote the <term>probability of a success</term> as 
        <m>p = 0.7</m>. The probability of a failure is sometimes denoted with 
        <m>q = 1 - p</m>, which would be 0.3 for the insurance example.
      </p>

      <p>
        When an individual trial only has two possible outcomes, often labeled as 
        <q>success</q> or <q>failure</q>, it is called a <term>Bernoulli random variable</term>. 
        We chose to label a person who does not hit her deductible as a <q>success</q> and 
        all others as <q>failures</q>. However, we could just as easily have reversed these 
        labels. The mathematical framework we will build does not depend on which outcome is 
        labeled a success and which a failure, as long as we are consistent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bernoulli random variables are often denoted as 1 for a success and 0 for a failure. 
        In addition to being convenient in entering data, it is also mathematically handy. 
        Suppose we observe ten trials:
      </p>

      <p>
        1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
      </p>

      <p>
        Then the <term>sample proportion</term>, <m>\hat{p}</m>, is the sample mean of 
        these observations:
        <me>
          \hat{p} = \frac{\text{number of successes}}{\text{number of trials}} = 
          \frac{1+1+1+0+1+0+0+1+1+0}{10} = 0.6
        </me>
        This mathematical inquiry of Bernoulli random variables can be extended even further. 
        Because 0 and 1 are numerical outcomes, we can define the mean and standard deviation 
        of a Bernoulli random variable. (See Exercises <xref ref="ex-bernoulli-mean-derivation"/> 
        and <xref ref="ex-bernoulli-sd-derivation"/>.)
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <term>Bernoulli random variable</term>
        </p>
        <p>
          If <m>X</m> is a random variable that takes value 1 with probability of success 
          <m>p</m> and 0 with probability <m>1-p</m>, then <m>X</m> is a Bernoulli random

      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In general, it is useful to think about a Bernoulli random variable as a random 
        process with only two outcomes: a success or failure. Then we build our mathematical 
        framework using the numerical labels 1 and 0 for successes and failures, respectively.

      <title>Geometric distribution</title>

      <p>
        The <term>geometric distribution</term> is used to describe how many trials it takes 
        to observe a success. Let's first look at an example.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="ex-wait-for-deductible">
        <title>Finding first success in insurance claims</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose we are working at the insurance company and need to find a case where 
            the person did not exceed her (or his) deductible as a case study. If the 
            probability a person will not exceed her deductible is 0.7 and we are drawing 
            people at random, what are the chances that the first person will not have 
            exceeded her deductible, i.e. be a success? The second person? The third? What 
            about we pull <m>n - 1</m> cases before we find the first success, i.e. the 
            first success is the <m>n^{th}</m> person? (If the first success is the fifth 
            person, then we say <m>n=5</m>.)
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The probability of stopping after the first person is just the chance the first 
            person will not hit her (or his) deductible: 0.7. The probability the second 
            person is the first to not hit her deductible is
            <md>
              <mrow>\amp P(\text{second person is the first to not hit deductible})</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \quad = P(\text{the first will, the second won't})</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \quad = (0.3)(0.7) = 0.21</mrow>
            </md>
            Likewise, the probability it will be the third case is 
            <m>(0.3)(0.3)(0.7) = 0.063</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the first success is on the <m>n^{th}</m> person, then there are <m>n-1</m> 
            failures and finally 1 success, which corresponds to the probability 
            <m>(0.3)^{n-1}(0.7)</m>. This is the same as <m>(1-0.7)^{n-1}(0.7)</m>.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>
        <xref ref="ex-wait-for-deductible"/> illustrates what the <term>geometric distribution</term> 
        is, which describes the waiting time until a success for <term>independent and 
        identically distributed (iid)</term> Bernoulli random variables. In this case, the 
        <em>independence</em> aspect just means the individuals in the example don't affect 
        each other, and <em>identical</em> means they each have the same probability of success.
      </p>

      <p>
        The geometric distribution from <xref ref="ex-wait-for-deductible"/> is shown in 
        <xref ref="fig-geometric-dist-70"/>. In general, the probabilities for a geometric 
        distribution decrease <term>exponentially</term> fast.

          failure is <m>1-p</m>, then the probability of finding the first success in the 
          <m>n^{th}</m> trial is given by
          <me>
            (1-p)^{n-1}p
          </me>
          The mean (i.e. expected value), variance, and standard deviation of this wait time 
          are given by
          <md>
            <mrow>\mu \amp = \frac{1}{p} \amp \sigma^2 \amp = \frac{1-p}{p^2} \amp

      <p>
        It is no accident that we use the symbol <m>\mu</m> for both the mean and expected 
        value. The mean and the expected value are one and the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        It takes, on average, <m>1/p</m> trials to get a success under the geometric 
        distribution. This mathematical result is consistent with what we would expect 
        intuitively. If the probability of a success is high (e.g. 0.8), then we don't 
        usually wait very long for a success: <m>1/0.8 = 1.25</m> trials on average. If 
        the probability of a success is low (e.g. 0.1), then we would expect to view many 
        trials before we see a success: <m>1/0.1 = 10</m> trials.

          <p>
            Suppose a car insurer has determined that 88% of its drivers will not exceed their 
            deductible in a given year. If someone at the company were to randomly draw driver 
            files until they found one that had not exceeded their deductible, what is the

            In this example, a success is again when someone will not exceed the insurance

      <p>
        The independence assumption is crucial to the geometric distribution's accurate 
        description of a scenario. Mathematically, we can see that to construct the probability 
        of the success on the <m>n^{th}</m> trial, we had to use the Multiplication Rule for 
        Independent Processes. It is no simple task to generalize the geometric model for 
        dependent trials.
