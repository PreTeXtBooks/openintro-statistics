  <title>Introduction to data</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful observations.
      These observations<mdash />collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and 
      experiments<mdash />form the backbone of a statistical investigation and are called 
      <term>data</term>. Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw 
      conclusions from data, and in this first chapter, we focus on both the properties of 
      data and on the collection of data.

    <title>Case study: using stents to prevent strokes</title>
    <idx>stroke</idx>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        This section introduces a classic challenge in statistics: evaluating the efficacy of 
        a medical treatment. Terms in this section, and indeed much of this chapter, will all 
        be revisited later in the text. The plan for now is simply to get a sense of the role 
        statistics can play in practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this section we will consider an experiment that studies effectiveness of stents in 
        treating patients at risk of stroke. Stents are devices put inside blood vessels that 
        assist in patient recovery after cardiac events and reduce the risk of an additional 
        heart attack or death. Many doctors have hoped that there would be similar benefits for 
        patients at risk of stroke. We start by writing the principal question the researchers 
        hope to answer:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Does the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke?
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The researchers who asked this question conducted an experiment with 451 at-risk patients. 
        Each volunteer patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups:
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Treatment group</term>. Patients in the treatment group received a stent and 
              medical management. The medical management included medications, management of risk 
              factors, and help in lifestyle modification.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Control group</term>. Patients in the control group received the same medical 
              management as the treatment group, but they did not receive stents.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Researchers randomly assigned 224 patients to the treatment group and 227 to the control 
        group. In this study, the control group provides a reference point against which we can 
        measure the medical impact of stents in the treatment group.
      </p>

      <p>
        Researchers studied the effect of stents at two time points: 30 days after enrollment and 
        365 days after enrollment. The results of 5 patients are summarized in 
        <xref ref="table-stent-study-results-df"/>. Patient outcomes are recorded as 
        <q>stroke</q> or <q>no event</q>, representing whether or not the patient had a stroke 
        at the end of a time period.

      Considering data from each patient individually would be a long, cumbersome path towards 
      answering the original research question. Instead, performing a statistical data analysis 
      allows us to consider all of the data at once. <xref ref="table-stent-study-results"/> 
      summarizes the raw data in a more helpful way. In this table, we can quickly see what 
      happened over the entire study. For instance, to identify the number of patients in the 
      treatment group who had a stroke within 30 days, we look on the left-side of the table at 
      the intersection of the treatment and stroke: 33.

      <title>Computing proportions from the stent study</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Of the 224 patients in the treatment group, 45 had a stroke by the end of the first 
          year. Using these two numbers, compute the proportion of patients in the treatment 
          group who had a stroke by the end of their first year.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The proportion of the 224 patients who had a stroke within 365 days: 
          <m>45/224 = 0.20</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      We can compute summary statistics from the table. A <term>summary statistic</term> is a 
      single number summarizing a large amount of data. For instance, the primary results of 
      the study after 1 year could be described by two summary statistics: the proportion of 
      people who had a stroke in the treatment and control groups.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Proportion who had a stroke in the treatment (stent) group: 
            <m>45/224 = 0.20 = 20\%</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Proportion who had a stroke in the control group: <m>28/227 = 0.12 = 12\%</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      These two summary statistics are useful in looking for differences in the groups, and we 
      are in for a surprise: an additional 8% of patients in the treatment group had a stroke! 
      This is important for two reasons. First, it is contrary to what doctors expected, which 
      was that stents would <em>reduce</em> the rate of strokes. Second, it leads to a 
      statistical question: do the data show a <q>real</q> difference between the groups?
    </p>

    <p>
      This second question is subtle. Suppose you flip a coin 100 times. While the chance a coin 
      lands heads in any given coin flip is 50%, we probably won't observe exactly 50 heads. This 
      type of fluctuation is part of almost any type of data generating process. It is possible 
      that the 8% difference in the stent study is due to this natural variation. However, the 
      larger the difference we observe (for a particular sample size), the less believable it is 
      that the difference is due to chance. So what we are really asking is the following: is 
      the difference so large that we should reject the notion that it was due to chance?
    </p>

    <p>
      While we don't yet have our statistical tools to fully address this question on our own, 
      we can comprehend the conclusions of the published analysis: there was compelling evidence 
      of harm by stents in this study of stroke patients.
    </p>

    <warning>
      <title>Be careful</title>
      <p>
        Do not generalize the results of this study to all patients and all stents. This study 
        looked at patients with very specific characteristics who volunteered to be a part of 
        this study and who may not be representative of all stroke patients. In addition, there 
        are many types of stents and this study only considered the self-expanding Wingspan stent 
        (Boston Scientific). However, this study does leave us with an important lesson: we 
        should keep our eyes open for surprises.

        <statement>
          <p>
            A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish 
            to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, 
            researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with 
            migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 
            43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed 
            to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture 
            (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received 
            acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the 
            contingency table below.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Effective organization and description of data is a first step in most analyses. This 
        section introduces the <em>data matrix</em> for organizing data as well as some 
        terminology about different forms of data that will be used throughout this book.

      <idx>loan50 data</idx>

      <p>
        <xref ref="table-loan50-df"/> displays rows 1, 2, 3, and 50 of a data set for 50 
        randomly sampled loans offered through Lending Club, which is a peer-to-peer lending 
        company. These observations will be referred to as the <c>loan50</c> data set.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each row in the table represents a single loan. The formal name for a row is a 
        <term>case</term> or <term>observational unit</term>. The columns represent 
        characteristics, called <term>variables</term>, for each of the loans. For example, 
        the first row represents a loan of <dollar/>22,000 with an interest rate of 10.90%, 
        where the borrower is based in New Jersey (NJ) and has an income of <dollar/>59,000.

        In practice, it is especially important to ask clarifying questions to ensure important

        The data in <xref ref="table-loan50-df"/> represent a <term>data matrix</term>, which 
        is a convenient and common way to organize data, especially if collecting data in a 
        spreadsheet. Each row of a data matrix corresponds to a unique case (observational unit), 
        and each column corresponds to a variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        When recording data, use a data matrix unless you have a very good reason to use a 
        different structure. This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables 
        as new columns.

        <title>Organizing a gradebook</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The grades for assignments, quizzes, and exams in a course are often recorded in a 
            gradebook that takes the form of a data matrix. How might you organize grade data 
            using a data matrix?

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            There are multiple strategies that can be followed. One common strategy is to have 
            each student represented by a row, and then add a column for each assignment, quiz, 
            or exam. Under this setup, it is easy to review a single line to understand a 
            student's grade history. There should also be columns to include student information, 
            such as one column to list student names.

        <idx>county data</idx>
        We consider data for 3,142 counties in the United States. The data includes each county's 
        name, the state where it resides, its population in 2017, how its population changed from 
        2010 to 2017, poverty rate, and six additional characteristics.

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-types-of-variables">
      <title>Types of variables</title>

      <p>
        Examine the <c>unemp_rate</c>, <c>pop</c>, <c>state</c>, and <c>median_edu</c> 
        variables in the <c>county</c> data set. Each of these variables is inherently different 
        from the other three, yet some share certain characteristics.
      </p>

      <p>
        First consider <c>unemp_rate</c>, which is said to be a <term>numerical</term> variable 
        since it can take a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add, subtract, 
        or take averages with those values. On the other hand, we would not classify a variable 
        reporting telephone area codes as numerical since the average, sum, and difference of 
        area codes doesn't have any clear meaning.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <c>pop</c> variable is also numerical, although it seems to be a little different 
        than <c>unemp_rate</c>. This variable of the population count can only take whole 
        non-negative numbers (0, 1, 2, <ellipsis/>). For this reason, the population variable is 
        said to be <term>discrete</term> since it can only take numerical values with jumps. 
        On the other hand, the unemployment rate variable is said to be <term>continuous</term>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The variable <c>state</c> can take up to 51 values after accounting for Washington, DC: 
        AL, AK, <ellipsis/>, and WY. Because the responses themselves are categories, 
        <c>state</c> is called a <term>categorical</term> variable, and the possible values are 
        called the variable's <term>levels</term>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, consider the <c>median_edu</c> variable, which describes the median education 
        level of county residents and takes values <c>below_hs</c>, <c>hs_diploma</c>, 
        <c>some_college</c>, or <c>bachelors</c> in each county. This variable seems to be a 
        hybrid: it is a categorical variable but the levels have a natural ordering. A variable 
        with these properties is called an <term>ordinal</term> variable, while a regular 
        categorical variable without this type of special ordering is called a 
        <term>nominal</term> variable. To simplify analyses, any ordinal variable in this book 
        will be treated as a nominal (unordered) categorical variable.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Data were collected about students in a statistics course. Three variables were 
            recorded for each student: number of siblings, student height, and whether the student 
            had previously taken a statistics course. Classify each of the variables as continuous 
            numerical, discrete numerical, or categorical.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The number of siblings and student height represent numerical variables. Because the 
            number of siblings is a count, it is discrete. Height varies continuously, so it is a 
            continuous numerical variable. The last variable classifies students into two 
            categories<mdash />those who have and those who have not taken a statistics 
            course<mdash />which makes this variable categorical.

      <title>Relationships between variables</title>

      <p>
        Many analyses are motivated by a researcher looking for a relationship between two or 
        more variables. A social scientist may like to answer some of the following questions:
      </p>

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If homeownership is lower than the national average in one county, will the percent 
              of multi-unit structures in that county tend to be above or below the national 
              average?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Does a higher than average increase in county population tend to correspond to 
              counties with higher or lower median household incomes?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              How useful a predictor is median education level for the median household income for 
              US counties?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        To answer these questions, data must be collected, such as the <c>county</c> data set. 
        Examining summary statistics could provide insights for each of the three questions about 
        counties. Additionally, graphs can be used to visually explore data.
      </p>

      <p>
        <term>Scatterplots</term> are one type of graph used to study the relationship between 
        two numerical variables. A scatterplot comparing the variables <c>homeownership</c> and 
        <c>multi_unit</c> (the percent of units in multi-unit structures such as apartments and 
        condos) shows that counties with a higher rate of multi-units tend to have lower 
        homeownership rates. We might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and 
        investigate each idea to determine which are the most reasonable explanations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The multi-unit and homeownership rates are said to be associated because the plot shows a 
        discernible pattern. When two variables show some connection with one another, they are 
        called <term>associated</term> variables. Associated variables can also be called 
        <term>dependent</term> variables and vice-versa.
