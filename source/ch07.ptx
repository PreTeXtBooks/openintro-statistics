  <introduction>
    <p>
      Chapter<nbsp/><xref ref="ch-foundations-for-inference"/> introduced a framework for 
      statistical inference based on confidence intervals and hypotheses using the normal 
      distribution for sample proportions. In this chapter, we encounter several new point 
      estimates and a couple new distributions. In each case, the inference ideas remain the 
      same: determine which point estimate or test statistic is useful, identify an appropriate 
      distribution for the point estimate or test statistic, and apply the ideas of inference.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Similar to how we can model the behavior of the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> using
        a normal distribution, the sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> can also be modeled using a normal
        distribution when certain conditions are met. However, we'll soon learn that a new
        distribution, called the <m>t</m>-distribution, tends to be more useful when working with
        the sample mean. We'll first learn about this new distribution, then we'll use it to
        construct confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests for the mean.

      <p>
        The sample mean tends to follow a normal distribution centered at the population mean, <m>\mu</m>,
        when certain conditions are met. Additionally, we can compute a standard error for the sample
        mean using the population standard deviation <m>\sigma</m> and the sample size <m>n</m>.

            When we collect a sufficiently large sample of <m>n</m> independent observations from a

      </theorem>
      
      <p>
        Before diving into confidence intervals and hypothesis tests using <m>\bar{x}</m>, we first
        need to cover two topics:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            When we modeled <m>\hat{p}</m> using the normal distribution, certain conditions had to be
            satisfied. The conditions for working with <m>\bar{x}</m> are a little more complex, and
            we'll spend Section<nbsp/><xref ref="x_bar_conditions"/> discussing how to check conditions
            for inference.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The standard error is dependent on the population standard deviation, <m>\sigma</m>. However,
            we rarely know <m>\sigma</m>, and instead we must estimate it. Because this estimation is
            itself imperfect, we use a new distribution called the <m>t</m>-distribution to fix this
            problem, which we discuss in Section<nbsp/><xref ref="introducingTheTDistribution"/>.

    <subsection xml:id="x_bar_conditions">
      <title>Evaluating the two conditions required for modeling <m>\bar{x}</m></title>
      
      <p>
        Two conditions are required to apply the Central Limit Theorem for a sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m>:
      </p>
      
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Independence.</title>
          <p>
            The sample observations must be independent. The most common way to satisfy this condition
            is when the sample is a simple random sample from the population. If the data come from a
            random process, analogous to rolling a die, this would also satisfy the independence condition.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Normality.</title>
          <p>
            When a sample is small, we also require that the sample observations come from a normally
            distributed population. We can relax this condition more and more for larger and larger
            sample sizes. This condition is obviously vague, making it difficult to evaluate, so next
            we introduce a couple rules of thumb to make checking this condition easier.
          </p>
        </li>
      </dl>
      
      <assemblage xml:id="normality-rules-thumb">
        <title>Rules of thumb: how to perform the normality check</title>
        <p>
          There is no perfect way to check the normality condition, so instead we use two rules of thumb:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title><m>n \lt 30</m>:</title>
            <p>
              If the sample size <m>n</m> is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data,
              then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the
              condition.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title><m>n \geq 30</m>:</title>
            <p>
              If the sample size <m>n</m> is at least 30 and there are no <em>particularly extreme</em>
              outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> is nearly
              normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
            </p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </assemblage>
      
      <p>
        In this first course in statistics, you aren't expected to develop perfect judgement on the
        normality condition. However, you are expected to be able to handle clear cut cases based on
        the rules of thumb.<fn>More nuanced guidelines would consider further relaxing the
        <em>particularly extreme outlier</em> check when the sample size is very large. However, we'll
        leave further discussion here to a future course.</fn>
      </p>
      
      <example xml:id="outliers_and_ss_condition_ex">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider the following two plots that come from simple random samples from different
            populations. Their sample sizes are <m>n_1 = 15</m> and <m>n_2 = 50</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            [Figure showing two histograms: Sample 1 Observations (n=15) with values 0-7, and Sample 2
            Observations (n=50) with values 0-22 with most data near zero and one outlier at 21-22]
          </p>
          <p>
            Are the independence and normality conditions met in each case?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Each sample is from a simple random sample of its respective population, so the independence
            condition is satisfied. Let's next check the normality condition for each using the rule of thumb.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first sample has fewer than 30 observations, so we are watching for any clear outliers.
            None are present; while there is a small gap in the histogram between 5 and 6, this gap is
            small and 20% of the observations in this small sample are represented in that far right bar
            of the histogram, so we can hardly call these clear outliers. With no clear outliers, the
            normality condition is reasonably met.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second sample has a sample size greater than 30 and includes an outlier that appears to
            be roughly 5 times further from the center of the distribution than the next furthest
            observation. This is an example of a particularly extreme outlier, so the normality condition
            would not be satisfied.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      
      <p>
        In practice, it's typical to also do a mental check to evaluate whether we have reason to believe
        the underlying population would have moderate skew (if <m>n \lt 30</m>) or have particularly
        extreme outliers (<m>n \geq 30</m>) beyond what we observe in the data. For example, consider
        the number of followers for each individual account on Twitter, and then imagine this distribution.
        The large majority of accounts have built up a couple thousand followers or fewer, while a
        relatively tiny fraction have amassed tens of millions of followers, meaning the distribution is
        extremely skewed. When we know the data come from such an extremely skewed distribution, it takes
        some effort to understand what sample size is large enough for the normality condition to be
        satisfied.

    <subsection xml:id="introducingTheTDistribution">
      <title>Introducing the <m>t</m>-distribution</title>
      
      <p>
        In practice, we cannot directly calculate the standard error for <m>\bar{x}</m> since we do not
        know the population standard deviation, <m>\sigma</m>. We encountered a similar issue when
        computing the standard error for a sample proportion, which relied on the population proportion,
        <m>p</m>. Our solution in the proportion context was to use the sample value in place of the
        population value when computing the standard error. We'll employ a similar strategy for computing
        the standard error of <m>\bar{x}</m>, using the sample standard deviation <m>s</m> in place of
        <m>\sigma</m>:
      </p>
      <me>
        SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \approx \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
      </me>
      <p>
        This strategy tends to work well when we have a lot of data and can estimate <m>\sigma</m> using
        <m>s</m> accurately. However, the estimate is less precise with smaller samples, and this leads
        to problems when using the normal distribution to model <m>\bar{x}</m>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We'll find it useful to use a new distribution for inference calculations called the
        <term><m>t</m>-distribution</term>. A <m>t</m>-distribution, shown as a solid line in
        Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="tDistCompareToNormalDist"/>, has a bell shape. However, its tails are
        thicker than the normal distribution's, meaning observations are more likely to fall beyond two
        standard deviations from the mean than under the normal distribution. The extra thick tails of
        the <m>t</m>-distribution are exactly the correction needed to resolve the problem of using
        <m>s</m> in place of <m>\sigma</m> in the <m>SE</m> calculation.
      </p>
      
      <figure xml:id="tDistCompareToNormalDist">

        <p>
          [Figure showing a standard normal distribution and a t-distribution overlaid. The t-distribution
          is more sharply peaked and has thicker tails than the normal distribution.]
        </p>
      </figure>
      
      <p>
        The <m>t</m>-distribution is always centered at zero and has a single parameter: degrees of
        freedom. The <term>degrees of freedom (<m>df</m>)</term> describes the precise form of the
        bell-shaped <m>t</m>-distribution. Several <m>t</m>-distributions are shown in
        Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="tDistConvergeToNormalDist"/> in comparison to the normal distribution.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In general, we'll use a <m>t</m>-distribution with <m>df = n - 1</m> to model the sample mean
        when the sample size is <m>n</m>. That is, when we have more observations, the degrees of freedom
        will be larger and the <m>t</m>-distribution will look more like the standard normal distribution;
        when the degrees of freedom is about 30 or more, the <m>t</m>-distribution is nearly
        indistinguishable from the normal distribution.

        The <m>t</m>-distribution allows us greater flexibility than the normal distribution when
        analyzing numerical data. In practice, it's common to use statistical software, such as R, Python,
        or SAS for these analyses. Alternatively, a graphing calculator or a <term><m>t</m>-table</term>
        may be used; the <m>t</m>-table is similar to the normal distribution table, and it may be found
        in Appendix<nbsp/>[reference to t-table], which includes usage instructions and examples for those
        who wish to use this option. No matter the approach you choose, apply your method using the

            suggest any clear outliers, since all observations are within 2.5 standard deviations of the

        When completing a hypothesis test for the one-sample mean, the process is nearly identical to
        completing a hypothesis test for a single proportion. First, we find the Z-score using the
        observed value, null value, and standard error; however, we call it a <term>T-score</term> since
        we use a <m>t</m>-distribution for calculating the tail area. Then we find the p-value using the
        same ideas we used previously: find the one-tail area under the sampling distribution, and double
        it.

        <statement>
          <p>
            With both the independence and normality conditions satisfied, we can proceed with a hypothesis
            test using the <m>t</m>-distribution. The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the
            sample of 100 runners from the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race are 97.32 and 16.98 minutes,
            respectively. Recall that the sample size is 100 and the average run time in 2006 was 93.29
            minutes. Find the test statistic and p-value. What is your conclusion?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            To find the test statistic (T-score), we first must determine the standard error:
          </p>
          <me>
            SE = 16.98 / \sqrt{100} = 1.70
          </me>
          <p>
            Now we can compute the <em>T-score</em> using the sample mean (97.32), null value (93.29),
            and <m>SE</m>:
          </p>
          <me>
            T = \frac{97.32 - 93.29}{1.70} = 2.37
          </me>
          <p>
            For <m>df = 100 - 1 = 99</m>, we can determine using statistical software (or a
            <m>t</m>-table) that the one-tail area is 0.01, which we double to get the p-value: 0.02.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data
            provide strong evidence that the average run time for the Cherry Blossom Run in 2017 is
            different than the 2006 average. Since the observed value is above the null value and we have
            rejected the null hypothesis, we would conclude that runners in the race were slower on average
            in 2017 than in 2006.

        When planning a study, researchers often want to know: How large should my sample be to

          <p>
            The <term>power</term> of a hypothesis test is the probability that the test correctly
            rejects a false null hypothesis. In other words, it's the probability of detecting an
            effect when one truly exists.

      <p>
        Power depends on several factors:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The <alert>significance level</alert> <m>\alpha</m> (lower <m>\alpha</m> means lower power)</li>
        <li>The <alert>effect size</alert> (larger effects are easier to detect)</li>
        <li>The <alert>sample size</alert> (larger samples provide more power)</li>
        <li>The <alert>variability</alert> in the data (less variability means more power)</li>
      </ul>

        Researchers typically aim for a power of 0.80 or higher, meaning an 80% chance of detecting
        a true effect.

      <title>Sample Size Determination</title>
      
      <p>
        Power calculations can be used to determine the necessary sample size for a study. The
        process involves specifying:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>The desired significance level <m>\alpha</m></li>
        <li>The desired power (typically 0.80)</li>
        <li>The minimum effect size you want to detect</li>
        <li>An estimate of the population standard deviation</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        With these inputs, statistical software or formulas can calculate the required sample size
        for each group. Adequate planning using power calculations helps ensure studies are neither
        underpowered (unable to detect real effects) nor wastefully large.

        Sometimes we want to compare means across more than two groups. For example, we might want
        to compare average test scores across four different teaching methods, or compare recovery
        times across three different treatments. When comparing multiple groups, we use

      <title>The <m>F</m>-Statistic</title>

      <ul>
        <li>If the null hypothesis is true (all means equal), we expect <m>F \approx 1</m>.</li>

      <title>Multiple Comparisons and What ANOVA Doesn't Tell Us</title>
      
      <p>
        When ANOVA gives a significant result, it tells us that at least one mean is different, but
        it doesn't tell us which means differ. To determine which specific groups differ, we need to
        conduct <term>multiple comparisons</term> or <term>post-hoc tests</term>.
      </p>
      
      <important>
        <p>
          <alert>Multiple Testing Problem:</alert> When conducting many pairwise comparisons, the
          chance of making at least one Type 1 error increases. Methods like the
          <term>Bonferroni correction</term> or <term>Tukey's HSD</term> help control this error rate.
        </p>
      </important>
      
      <p>
        A simple approach is the <term>Bonferroni correction</term>: If conducting <m>m</m> tests,
        use <m>\alpha/m</m> as the significance level for each individual test to maintain an
        overall significance level of approximately <m>\alpha</m>.
