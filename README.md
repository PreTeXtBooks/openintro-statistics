## Building the Book

This project uses PreTeXt to generate HTML and PDF output. The build system is configured in `project.ptx`.

### HTML Output

To build the HTML version:
```bash
pretext build web
```
The HTML output is generated to the `output/html/` directory (which is gitignored).

### PDF Output

To build the PDF version:
```bash
pretext build pdf
```
The PDF output is generated to the `output/pdf/` directory (which is gitignored).

## Published Site

The HTML version of the book is published via GitHub Pages on the `gh-pages` branch.

Note: Build artifacts (HTML files, output directories, logs) are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## Contributing

When working on this project:
- Edit source files in the `source/` directory
- Build artifacts are automatically generated and should not be committed
- The `gh-pages` branch contains the deployed HTML output
