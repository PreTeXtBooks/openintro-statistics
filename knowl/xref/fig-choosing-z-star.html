Portions of the normal distribution have been shaded. First, the central 95% portion of the distribution has been shaded in a dark blue, and this region has an annotation stating 95%, extends from -1.96 to 1.96. Recall that the value of 1.96 closely matches our 68-95-99.7 rule for the normal distribution, which had stated that about 95% of the area under the normal distribution lied within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Second, a slightly broader region of the normal distribution is shaded, in this case from about -2.5 to positive 2.5, and this has an annotation stating, 99%, extends -2.58 to 2.58. The values described here -- 1.96 and 2.58 -- are the z-star values that we would use for 95% and 99% confidence intervals, respectively."></div>
