The horizontal axis is for "family income" and has values ranging from $0 to about $300,000. The vertical axis is for "gift aid" and has values ranging from $0 to about $35,000. Two lines are fit to the data showing a slight downward trend. One of those lines is a solid line representing what is called the "least squares line". About 10 observations are shown where family income is between $0 and $50,000, and gift aid for these values is roughly between $17,000 and $28,000. About 20 observations are shown where family income is between $50,000 and $100,000, and gift aid for these values is roughly between $10,000 and $33,000. About 10 observations are shown where family income is between $100,000 and $150,000, and gift aid for these values is roughly between $9,000 and $25,000. Three observations are shown where family income is between $150,000 and $200,000, and gift aid for these values are $25,000, $12,000, and $13,000. Six more observations are shown where family income is larger than $200,000, and gift aid for these values ranges from about $7,000 to $22,000. The data in this graph will be frequently discussed throughout this section and referred to as the "Elmhurst data".'></div>
