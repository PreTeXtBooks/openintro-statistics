Each scatterplot appears to represent about 50 points. The first has a correlation of R equals 0.33, and there is a slight upward trend evident in the data -- if a trend line were drawn for this data, much of the data would fall relatively far from the line. The second plot has a correlation of R equals 0.69, and a clearer upward trend is evident, but it is still pretty volatile with many points deviating far from where the trend line would be. The third plot has a correlation of 0.98, and the data show a very clear upward trend, where if a trend line were drawn, the data would be (relatively) quite close to this line. The fourth plot shows a correlation of R equals 1.00, and here the points appear exactly on a line with an upward trajectory. The fifth plot shows data with a correlation of R equals 0.08, where no trend is visually evident in the data. The sixth plot has a correlation of R equals -0.64, and a downward trend is evident in the data, but the individual observations would in many cases be pretty distant from any trend line fit to the data (on a relative basis). The seventh plot has a correlation of R equals -0.92 and shows data with a clear downward trend, where the data would deviate just a modest amount from a trend line fit to the data. The last plot shows a correlation of R equals -1, where the observations would fit exactly on a line trending downwards."></div>
