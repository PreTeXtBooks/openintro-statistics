The two points for the Great Depression have been removed, and a least squares regression line has been fit to the data with a slightly downward trend. The horizontal axis is for "Unemployment Rate" with values ranging from about 3% to 12%. The vertical axis is for "Percent Change in Seats of the President’s Party in the House of Representatives" with values ranging from about -30% to positive 10%. The bulk of the observations have Unemployment Rate between 3% and 8%, and these have the percent change in seats ranging from about -27% to positive 4% without any discernible trend. There are four observations with unemployment rate above 8%, and these have the percent change in seats ranging from -25% to -9%. Each point in the scatterplot is also labeled as "Democrat" in blue or "Republican" in red, though this doesn’t reveal any additional pattern.'></div>
