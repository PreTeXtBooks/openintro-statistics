All data sets have at least one outlier. (1) A clear positive upward trend is evident in the points with a regression line overlaying these points, but one point is shown deviating substantially from the line about one-third of the way from the left side of the plot and far below the other points. (2) A slight downward trend is evident in the points on the left half of the plot with a regression line overlaying these points and extending to a single point on the far right of the plot that is also very close to the regression line. (3) A positive upward trend is evident for points shown on the left two-thirds of the plot with a regression line overlaying these points, but a single point is shown on the far right and lying substantially above the line. This one point appears to be "pulling" the regression line up on the right, making the line fit the rest of the data less well. (4) Most of the data is shown in the left two-thirds of the plot with a clear downward, linear trend. A cluster of 4 points is shown on the far right but deviating notably above the trend of the other points. The regression line fit to the data shows it largely "trying" to fit the bulk of the data on the left but being "pulled" upward on the right towards the cluster of points deviating from the linear trend. (5) A large cluster of points is shown on the far bottom-left, and there is no apparent trend in this large cluster. A single point is shown on the far upper-right. A regression line is fit to the data with a line extending from the cluster on the bottom-left and trending upwards near the single point on the upper right. (6) A clear downward trend is evident in the points on the right two-thirds of the plot with a regression line overlaying these points and extending to a single point on the far left of the plot that is also very close to the regression line.'></div>
