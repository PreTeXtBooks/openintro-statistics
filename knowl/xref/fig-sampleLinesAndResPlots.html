The upper left plot shows a scatterplot where the data trend downwards steadily with a straight line fit to the data, which appears to fit well everywhere. The bottom left plot is the residual plot of this first scatterplot, and it likewise shows no pattern in the residuals when looking left to right. The upper middle plot shows data with a downward trend, but the data’s trend is more steep on the right side of the plot, so the overall shape of the data is that it trends downward and curves downward. A straight, downward-trending line has also been fit to this data, but it doesn’t fit as well. The data are below this downward trending line initially, but it is above the line in the middle, and finally on the right it is once again below the linear trend line. The residual plot for this scatterplot is shown in the lower middle plot, and the curvature in the residuals is more evident than what was visible in the scatterplot: the residuals have negative values on the left and trend upwards until peaking with positive residuals in the middle, and then trending back down and having negative residual values again on the right. The last scatterplot in the upper right shows data with very little trend, but a slightly-upward trending straight line has been fit to the data. The corresponding residual plot, shown as the bottom right plot, also shows data with no evident trend or pattern, where observations appear relatively randomly scattered above and below 0 (in the vertical)."></div>
