These four examples show when methods in this chapter are insufficient to apply to the data. In the first set, a scatterplot with arch-shaped data is shown with a straight line fit to the data, which poorly fits the curved nature of the data; this is meant to highlight an example where "linearity" fails. In the second set, a set of data with a line fit is shown, where the data tightly pack around the line, except one point in particular that is far from the line and represents the case where there are "extreme outliers" in the data. The third set shows a case where a straight line fits the data, but the variability around the line changes, where observations tend to be quite close to the line on the left, but when looking further right, the observations tend to be increasingly far from the line, indicating "changing variability" in the residuals over different regions of the plot. The fourth set provides another case of what is called "time series" data, which is a context where "successive observations are correlated".'></div>
